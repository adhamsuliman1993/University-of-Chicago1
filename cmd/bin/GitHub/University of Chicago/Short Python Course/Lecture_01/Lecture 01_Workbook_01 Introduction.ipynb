    "* Python is born out of the ABC language and the Amoeba distributed operating system, a project abandoned by Dutch DWI research institure.\n",
    "* The name **Python** is in reference to *Monty Python's Flying Circus*  \n",
    "* It reached v1.0 in early 1994 and with growing support from the community Python 2.0 was released in the year 2000 as an open source high level, general purpose, object oriented programming language.\n",
    "* Python 2.0 moved its repository to SourceForge, granting accss to developers. The release notes stated, **'the most important change in Python 2.0 may not be to the code at all, but to how Python is developed'**.\n",
    "* Python 3.0 was released in 2008 with a complete overhaul in the language with no backwards compatibility.   \n",
    "* Python 2.7 will continue to be supported until 2020 however Python 3.X is the future of the language\n",
    "* As of 2017 Python is the #1 programming language used for enterprise and scientific computing ranked by <a href='https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2017'>IEEE</a>.\n"

    "\n",
    "* Python is considered first and foremost a scripting language for the following reasons:  \n",
    "    1- It has shell scripting capabilities, meaning it can be used to code operating-system-oriented scrips. It is not the best tool for this task but it can serve this role.    \n",
    "    2- It can act as a glue layer implemented in the context of larger applications in the capacity of a control language that can be used to test, protptype and control hardware devices. A very popular application is <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi'>Raspberry Pi</a>.  \n",
    "    3- Most importantly however Python allows much faster program development than compiled languages such as C++ or Java.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Python has many applications such as systems programming, GUI's, networking and online scripting, interfacing with databases however most important to us is the fact that Python has grown to become one of the most important languages for numeric and scientific programming with a plethora of highly developed modules such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikil-learn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels."
